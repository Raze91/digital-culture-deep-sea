    <h1 class="center-title">What exactly is the deep sea ?</h1>

    <p class="center">
        The deep sea or deep layer is the lowest layer in the ocean, existing below the thermocline and above the
        seabed, at a depth of 1000 fathoms (1800 m) or more. Little or no light penetrates this part of the ocean, and
        most of the organisms that live there rely for subsistence on falling organic matter produced in the photic
        zone. For this reason, scientists once assumed that life would be sparse in the deep ocean, but virtually every
        probe has revealed that, on the contrary, life is abundant in the deep ocean.
    <p>
    <p class="center">
        It has been suggested that more is known about the Moon than the deepest parts of the ocean. Life on the deep
        ocean floor was assumed to rely solely on falling organic matter, and therefore ultimately the sun, for its
        energy source until the discovery of thriving colonies of shrimps and other organisms around hydrothermal vents
        in the late 1970s. The new discoveries revealed groups of creatures that obtained nutrients and energy directly
        from thermal sources and chemical reactions associated with changes to mineral deposits. These organisms thrive
        in completely lightless and anaerobic environments in highly saline water that may reach 300 °F (150 °C),
        drawing their sustenance from hydrogen sulfide, which is highly toxic to almost all terrestrial life. The
        revolutionary discovery that life can exist under these extreme conditions changed opinions about
        the chances of there being life elsewhere in the universe. Scientists now speculate that Europa, one of
        Jupiter's moons, may be able to support life beneath its icy surface, where there is evidence of a global
        ocean of liquid water.

                <br> <br>
                Scalding hot water pouring from these vents enriches

                <br> <br>
                This discovery rocks the scientific community because, for the first time, an ecosystem has been found
