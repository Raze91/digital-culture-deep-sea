    <h1>Deep Sea Exploration</h1>
    <p>
        About 71% of our planet's surface is covered in water, with the most of it still being a mystery. <br/>
        Through the ages and with the evolution of technology, mankind gradually overcame their fear of the depths
        to explore more and more.
    <p>
        Let's see how that exploration progressed through time :

                Known as FRNS-2, it is the first untethered craft to carry people into the deep waters of the ocean.
                It sets several world diving records, beating those of the bathyspheres, since no unwieldy cable is

                Scalding hot water pouring from these vents enriches

                Declassification of Geosat satellite radar altimetry data leads to worldwide mapping of the sea floor

                <br> <br>
                Launched in 1985 by the U.S. Navy, Geosat measures the height of the sea surface by bouncing
                a radar beam off it. In 1995, the Navy finally declassifies the Geosat data.
